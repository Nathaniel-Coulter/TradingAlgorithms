To be paired with our models (Multivariate GARCH, Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo). My favorite two algorithms in this repository are the TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) algorithms that use time series and the afformentioned models to predict the random fluctuations in the pricing of equity futures and place trades accordingly based on Variance, Covariance. I would reccomend these to prospective Quants because the underlying "theroies" are easily grasped until you get into the modeling aspect. Those being Standard Deviation and Mean Reversion from Statistics.(As you will come to see my friends, the trading strategies aren't the hard part. It's getting the most accurate results from our models that takes the most energy.)
